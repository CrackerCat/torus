## Description
`torus` is an experimental PoC (Proof-Of-Concept) utility that performs reads specific bytes from a decompressed `vmlinuz` kernel image by using `System.map`, so that signature scanning can be performed to find the addresses of kernel functions within kernel virtual memory from userspace.

### Features
- Disassembly output
- Checks for anomalies/modifications within kernel code

### Built with
- C

## Getting started
### Compiling
To compile `torus`, simply execute the following script:
- `./build.sh`

### Usage
- `./torus <path/to/vmlinuz>`
