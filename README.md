## Description
`torus` is an experimental PoC (Proof-Of-Concept) utility that performs reads specific bytes from a decompressed `vmlinuz` kernel image by using `System.map`, so that signature scanning can be performed to find the addresses of kernel functions within kernel virtual memory from userspace.

### Features
- Disassembly output
- Reports the addresses of the located kernel functions

### Built with
- C

## Getting started
### Compiling
To compile `torus`, simply execute the following script:
- `./build.sh`

### Decompressing vmlinuz
In order to decompress `vmlinuz` (located in `/boot`) so you can pass it to `torus` as an argument, download and run the script provided at:

- `https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/scripts/extract-vmlinux`

### Usage
- `./torus <decompressed_vmlinuz>`
